DESCRIPTION
The folder contains the MATLAB and Simulink files that are used in the Controls Tech Talk titled "Understanding Model Predictive Control, Part 6: How To Design An MPC Controller With Simulink And Model Predictive Control Toolbox" 

************************************
The folder contains the following items:
1-'AutonomousSteeringSystem.slx': This is the Simulink model used in the video.
2-'Meldas_library.slx': This is the custom library used in the video.
3-'Car.jpg': This is the image used for the mask of the Plant block that can be found in the custom library.
4-'Reference.jpg': This is the image used for the mask of the Reference block that can be found in the custom library.
5-'Params.mat': This mat-file includes all the parameters that are needed to run the Simulink model.
